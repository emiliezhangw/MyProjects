If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
I think Orange should be the listener's "Audio Aura". As we can see from the table, the Average energy is 0.65906 and high energy is one of the
feature of their lisetning apperaence, And Also those music has high key, which average is 5.33, the highest key is 11. It somewhat means the listener
need high-energy sounds.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
The way I calculated this aura did not take the weight of music into account. Maybe most of the music is high key and energy, while the most weighted
music is not so. So, We can give weight and take more features into account when deciding their Audio Aura.
